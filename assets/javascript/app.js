}

// ^^^^Should this function have the timer mechanism to not load immediately on function call??

// Will need if/else for each correct answer?
// Do every correct answer in one if (use || for or)?


/* MAIN PROCESS =========================================
 */

// How much of the process does this block need to contain?****

    $("#game-start").hide();

    $(".answers").show();

    // Call a function to start rendering questions??
    // renderQuestion();
    });


// After start is clicked, the game begins

// The first question with buttons for 4 possible answers needs to render, along with a timer for answering just this question*********

// For loop? Do/while loop?
// playerGuess part needs to be linked where "this" is





// THIS ISN'T LINKED TO ANYTHING YET, JUST PUZZLE PIECE
    // If there are no more questions, stop the function
    if (triviaIndex === triviaArray.length) {

    // Something that captures which button is pressed????
    // "value" related to the button value!!

    console.log("You chose: " + playerGuess);

    // After each answer is selected, a screen displays telling user if correct,

    // Increment the trivia question index variable and call the renderQuestion function

// After a set amount of time, the next question and answer set will appear

// This will repeat for the length of the trivia array





/* For total game ending screen, say something like:

*/

// Want Flash Theme to play on end screen!!!!
