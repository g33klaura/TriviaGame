/* FUNCTIONS =========================================
*/

// Will need if/else for each correct answer
// Do every correct answer in one if (use || for or)?

// Testing question
console.log(trivia.q2[0]);
// Testing answers retrieval
console.log(trivia.q2[1]);
console.log(triviaArray[1][1]);
// Looks like either of these methods work....

// When buttons for answers generate, they need to be in a random order
